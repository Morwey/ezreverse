## Background Modifier

A simple online tool for image background manipulation including inverting the background without changing the original colors, and changing the background color.

### Features

- **Invert Background**: Without altering the original colors, this function transforms the RGB image into different color spaces like YIQ, HSL, LAB, and inverts their corresponding channels.
- **Change Background Color**: By calculating the standard deviation of RGB values of each pixel in an image and using a specific threshold, this function filters out images that possibly have black or white backgrounds.
